        <h1>CONNOISSEUR OF LOVE</h1>

        <p>Hello Copper how are you?<br>
        I hope you had your food;<br>
        But let’s talk later about life,<br>
        As right now I’m in poetic mood.</p>

        <p>Your memories are like butterflies,<br>
        And your love is like a cake:<br>
        No matter how much I try,<br>
        Your thoughts always keep me awake.</p>

        <p>How long will you hide your love,<br>
        Not your rejection but your actions reveal your feelings;<br>
        You can use a bandage for your cuts,<br>
        But the scar in my heart has no such healings.</p>

        <p>It has been two years for our love,<br>
        Also since I shook hands with any girl with comfort;<br>
        And almost one year will pass without us talking,<br>
        But “MY LOVE’ you too know, my words weren’t meant to hurt.</p>

        <p>Two days before the physics exam,<br>
        You thought u would fail;<br>
        So I used some motivating yet bitter words,<br>
        But u took it in a wrong way and put me in a jail.</p>

        <p>Physics was your weak point,<br>
        And chemistry was mine;<br>
        You aced in the paper,<br>
        But our chemistry did not shine.</p>

        <p>That jail contains guilt and too much silence,<br>
        But still you will only be my special one;<br>
        I just want back that license,<br>
        And again I will become a bullet and u become my gun.</p>

        <p>I know that religion is the only reason,<br>
        Because of which you cut this beautiful line;<br>
        But for you I can become your favourite season,<br>
        And even change my religion to make you mine.</p>

        <p>Love like the falling petal,<br>
        Is the movie u suggested me to watch;<br>
        Without ‘A’ I want the gold metal,<br>
        But I must say, your choice is topnotch.</p>

        <p>Really you are like a divine power, <br>
        Whose gravitation keeps me attracted;<br>
        But sometimes my studies lower,<br>
        As the image of your smiling face keeps me distracted.</p>

        <p>You come in my dreams atleast three times a week,<br>
        But there is one unforgettable dream which I cannot miss;<br>
        So there too initially you denied that u loved me,<br>
        But finally you conveyed it all through a beautiful kiss.</p>

        <p>So be ready in next five years I will be at your place,<br>
        To ask you out for marriage in front of your dear dad;<br>
        I promise that would cause no harm,<br>
        And u will surely feel very glad.</p>

        <p>Last but not the least, my success would only be my satisfaction,<br>
        But my entire happiness lies only in YOU;<br>
        I can achieve anything through manifestation,<br>
        And I request God that the bride hiding my name in her mehandi<br>
        Should be none other than YOU.</p>

        <p>After our marriage our emotions will react,<br>
        And the product will be our kids, two in fact;<br>
        Such that they be the lotion and we their calamine,<br>
        And since then forever, we will be each others, special valentine!</p>

        <p>- BY SOMEONE</p>
