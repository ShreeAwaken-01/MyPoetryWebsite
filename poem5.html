    <h1>Love Lord Life</h1>
    <div class="poem">
        <p>
            “Like Lord Vishnu we met, you thought I’m a child,<br>
            And now you are in the lake of my love with endless bottom,<br>
            Where I am always your guardian as a crocodile, peaceful not wild,<br>
            And will always be with you in warm springs and cool autumn.<br><br>

            My divine ancient love is like 216 feet tall granite tower,<br>
            Brought up by emotions of like thousands of elephants by my side,<br>
            No dark shadow can destroy this power,<br>
            Survived many emotional earthquakes, my tower, still shines in pride.<br><br>

            Sweetheart for you I will consume poison of nine kind,<br>
            And get healed up and gain more purity from inside,<br>
            My sweet heart will never be stolen, if so, it will have to rewind,<br>
            As my flame of love keeps burning forever for only you, may it rain or storm aside.<br><br>

            I am that special flag waving opposite to wind direction,<br>
            Yeah its beyond science just like our special connection.<br>
            I wanna be the violet color from rainbow to feel your warm touch,<br>
            And you surely know I’m not a simp who wants dessert before the lunch.<br><br>

            My kalyug of love will continue until the fourth pillar falls,<br>
            Causing the destruction of this beautiful earth,<br>
            So before walking a baby first crawls,<br>
            And even before it takes a new birth.<br><br>

            So our souls will come again into existence,<br>
            With greater love and more persistence,<br>
            Such that I will become music and you my studio,<br>
            And then ***** Zahra will be known instead of Juliet and Romeo.”

    <h2>Meaning</h2>
    <div class="meaning">
        <p>
            0.TITLE ITSELF IS VERY DEEP…LOVE LORD LIFE……MY LIFE IS COMPLETELY DEPENDENT ON THE LORD WHOM I LOVE AND THEN LOVED ONES (LIKE FAMILY ZAHRA AND  TWO IDIOTS) WHO ARE LIKE LORD FOR ME…..
<br><br>
            
            1. **First Stanza**:                     Ananthapura Lake Temple
•	Location: Situated in Kasaragod, Kerala, this is the only lake temple in the state, believed to be the Moolasthanam (original seat) of Lord Anantha Padmanabha of Thiruvananthapuram.
•	Lord & Crocodile Mystery: The temple was guarded by a crocodile named Babiya, who was vegetarian and fed only the temple's prasad. Astonishingly, every time one crocodile died, another mysteriously appeared!
•	Lord Vishnu’s Meeting: It is believed that Lord Vishnu once appeared here as a child and met his devotee .
•	Bottomless Lake Mystery: The temple’s lake is believed to be bottomless, with its depth never successfully measured.
.<br><br>
            
            2. **Second Stanza**: Brihadeeswarar Temple
•	Location: Situated in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, built by Raja Raja Chola I in 1010 AD.
•	Height: Stands 216 feet tall, one of the tallest temples in the world.
•	Granite Structure: Entirely made of granite, despite no natural granite sources nearby.
•	1000 Elephants: Over 1000 elephants were used to transport the massive granite blocks.[Elephants are the most emotional mammals…so waisa reference]
•	No Shadow Mystery: The Vimana (tower) casts no shadow on the ground at noon, an architectural wonder.
•	Earthquake-Defying: Despite multiple earthquakes, the temple remains intact and undamaged for over 1000 years.
.<br><br>

            3. **Third Stanza**: Murugan Temple
•	Location: Situated in Palani, Tamil Nadu, dedicated to Lord Murugan.
•	Nine Poisons to Amrit: The temple’s sacred mixture, made of nine deadly poisons (Navapashanam), miraculously transforms into a pure healing substance.
•	Stolen Idol Returns: The idol was once stolen, but mysteriously returned on its own to the temple.[And idol (Moorthi) is the heart of any temple and when I said rewind it means to return…so waisa reference…]
•	Self-Burning Flame: A divine flame in the temple burns eternally, without any known fuel source, and has never been extinguished even in rainy and stormy weather.
.<br><br>

            4. **Fourth Stanza**:                          Jagannath Temple
•	Location: Situated in Puri, Odisha, dedicated to Lord Jagannath.
•	Opposite Direction Flag: The temple flag flutters against the wind, defying natural physics.
•	7 Pots Cooking Mystery: While 7 pots are stacked on top of each other for cooking daily prashaad for devotees, the topmost (7th)  pot gets heated first, an unexplained phenomenon.[ Also addition to it….when rainbow occurs, Red is the 1st colour to become visible (as it has highest wavelength) and violet  is the 7th colour…..so 7th pot ko 7th colour of rainbow se compare kiya maine…waisa reference….]
•	Last line of this stanza: Life ke events is compared to daily meals as follows: Breakfast- knowing each other, Lunch- Marriage, Supper (evening breakfast)- Giving birth to kids, Dinner- Getting older. So if ur marrying at lunch and want kids at supper then u must eat the dessert- sexual intercourse after lunch……So this means that writer (ofc LEGEND) is not a simp …he is not like many other boys who want just sex before marriage [Vo weird expression mat do (if any) as u are mature enough now (hopefully)] {So his love is for her soul and not for her body…..So Zahra, YOU ofc know it all…..waisa reference diya hai maine…}
.<br><br>

            5. **Fifth Stanza**:                       Kedareshwar Cave Temple
•	Location: Situated in Harishchandragad, Maharashtra, inside a cave surrounded by water, dedicated to Lord Shiva.
•	Four Pillars Prophecy: The temple originally had four pillars, but now only one remains. It is believed that when the last pillar falls, Kalyug will end, bringing the destruction of the world.
<br><br>

            6. **Final Stanza**: *****: U already know  ….<br><br>
