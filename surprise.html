                <p>Dear Zahra…..How are you ? I mean its been a year now……and so sorry if any inconvenience is caused due to this KC college stuff…it was mandatory or else u wouldn’t have read anything. It takes a lot of efforts to make such websites…..Even the poems…..Yes Poems….here there are no articles but poems that are written by me specially for you. Just one request please read all the poems….Also the last one is not best emotions wise but I bet 99.99999% no one has ever tried anything like this….I’m the first one and its really something unique (like me) and legendary…..And one request…Please don’t draw any conclusions after reading the poems…Also don’t think ki why does he still think about me and etc etc…Neither in an emotional way nor in humanity way…..I know ur kind hearted and will probably feel something ambiguious but u will get to show ur humanity…But u will have to show up on that day….Like wtv corner of India u are present I will come there but 1 meetup is needed …just one…..Please……..That day might take up a year or maybe couple of years…idk….but will surely come…..And on that day whatever happens I can guarantee u three things….1000000% …1)”I don’t believe in teenage love”…from this statement ‘don’t’ and ‘teenage’ these words will vanish……2) You will get a clear idea about what exactly love is and someone can go to what extent to achieve it and u will actually be amazed and glad to hear all those things……3) If whatever u felt earlier was genuine but just that one reason bcoz of which u backed off… then after that day everything will seem easier. For sure 101%.....If possible rate my all poems 1-10 by replying to that e-mail……. And also just name the course ur doing as ur post graduation…Thanku….have a good day and ofc night as well (sloth loves sleep more than sunshine)!...So yeah bye bye….Click on read poems to navigate further….</p>
